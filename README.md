## FashGAN
FashGAN is my first GAN (Generative Adversarial Neural Network) project. GANs are a powerful Neural Network giving the ability to learn and Imagine just like a human brain.

### Description
This project has been based on the tensorflow dataset api(tfds). I have used the "Fashion-MNIST" dataset to train this GAN to generate new synthetic fashion and wardrobe images in grayscale.
All images are in 28x28 dimension and in grayscale format.

I have given my best to document everything include suggestions, mistakes and best practices in the code in the form of comments.
